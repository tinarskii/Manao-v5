## 🤔 About

Manao is an all-in-one streaming toolkit that packs an essential set of features and utilities, reducing
the need for multiple third-party services. Manao supports multiple streaming platforms (i.e. Twitch, and Kick) and
Discord. It has a built-in chat overlay, music request system, soundboard, and a powerful custom command system that
can be executed by multiple platforms with a single codebase. 

With the release of Manao v5, Manao has been completely rewritten from the ground up, to allow for future expansion to more platforms.
Not only that, the web dashboard and setup wizard has been rebuilt using React (SPA) with Vite. Along with a new Go-based installer that makes setup 
a lot easier.

context.user.id                  // Internal Manao UserID (For linking account) 
context.user.platform            // Platform of the user (e.g. "twitch","kick", "discord")

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option A: Installer (Recommended)

Download the latest installer for your platform from the [Releases page](https://gitlab.com/mymanao/installer/-/releases).

Run the installer and follow the on-screen setup wizard. It will:
1. Install Bun automatically if not present
2. Clone the Manao repository
3. Build the dashboard and setup wizard
4. Create desktop shortcuts

### Option B: Manual Install

Prerequisites: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinarskii/Manao-v5.git
cd Manao-v5
bun install
bun run dashboard:build
bun run setup:build
```

Then run the setup wizard:

```bash
bun run setup
```

Open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser and follow the steps to configure your platforms.

Once setup is complete, start the bot:

```bash
bun start
```

## 🙋 FAQ & Troubleshooting

### How do I set up Twitch credentials?

Run the setup wizard (`bun run setup`) and navigate to the Twitch page. Enter your Client ID and Client Secret from the [Twitch Developer Portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/), then click **Authorize** to complete OAuth for both your bot account and broadcaster account.

### How do I set up Kick?

Create an app at [kick.com/settings/developer](https://kick.com/settings/developer), enter your credentials in the setup wizard, then click **Authorize Kick Account**. Kick EventSub webhooks require [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), add your auth token in the wizard as well.

### Is Windows supported?

Yes. The Go installer handles setup on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Bun v1.0+ has native Windows support.

### The dashboard shows no data, what do I do?

Make sure the bot is running (`bun start`) before opening the dashboard. The dashboard connects via WebSocket and requires the bot process to be active.

### How do I report a security vulnerability?

Do not open a public issue. Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vkW7YMyYaf) and DM `@acsp` (Tin) directly.
